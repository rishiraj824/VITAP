         <h3 class="vitblue">Dr.G.VISWANATHAN - Chancellor</h3>
        <p> Dr. GV, the founder-chancellor of VIT University, was born on December 8, 1938 in a remote village near Vellore in Tamil Nadu. Dr. GV’s life is a source of inspiration to the modern-day youth.
        <br>
        </p><h3 class="vitblue">Dr. GV − the Student </h3>
        <p>Dr. GV completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2003, nearly four decades after his University education, reaffirming his urge to be an eternal student. He excelled in academics right through childhood. His early education was confined to his small village where he studied in his mother tongue, Tamil. His pre university education at Voorhees College, Vellore, initiated him to the world outside. From there he went on to obtain his bachelors and Masters Degrees in Economics from the prestigious Loyola College, Chennai. Following this, he graduated in Law from the Madras Law College.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="vitblue">Dr. GV − the leader of the people </h3>
       <p> A student leader in his twenties entering Indian parliament was something unthinkable, especially in 1960s. He championed people’s issues in the parliament and they, in turn, reposed faith in the leader who fulfilled their expectations. They re-elected him by a bigger margin in the next election for another five-year term. He travelled to different parts of the world as a member of parliamentary delegations and appreciated issues in a global perspective. Dr. GV wanted to play a bigger role in the provincial politics so that he can make a direct contribution in bettering the lives of the people in the region. He was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for ten years. During this period, he served as a Minister for two years.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="vitblue">Dr. GV − the educator </h3>
       <p> Dr.GV founded Vellore Engineering College in 1984 at Vellore. He envisaged that this institution would offer world-class education to students who would in turn create an indelible impact on the society. The engineering college that started with an intake of 180 students in 1984 has evolved as a university with two campuses. Over 25,000 students are enrolled in 53 undergraduate and graduate programs with nearly 16,000 residing on the campus. It attracts students and professors from different parts of the world. It houses more than 1000 international students on campus. For the past two years, VIT University has been ranked #1 private engineering institution in India. ISO Certification from Holland, International accreditation from the United Kingdom and the USA, and the highest accreditation grade from the Government of India reflect the University’s penchant for excellence on all fronts.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="vitblue">Dr. GV − the institution </h3>
       <p> <strong>Dr. GV’s</strong> passion for societal development and compassion for the underprivileged have resulted in the introduction of several schemes for uplifting the women and unemployed youth in the region to help them become self-reliant. Dr. GV offers scholarships to students from disadvantaged sections of the society to enable them to pursue higher studies. Dr.GV has established the Universal Higher Education Trust to create opportunities for higher education to every deserving student in the region. He has adopted several villages in an effort to improve the quality of lives of the rural people. His vision of transforming Vellore into a greener and cooler town by planting one million saplings has begun to yield fruit. Dr.GV’s farsightedness extends beyond horizons.</p>
