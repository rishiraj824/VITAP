                  Welcome Message<br></p>

              </div>
              <p>Dear VITian,<br><br>

              Hearty Congratulations on getting admission into VIT-AP and joining the VIT family. I would like to

              appreciate your hard work for making it through VITEEE 2017. I also congratulate your parents for being

              pillars of support enabling your success.<br><br>

              <b>International Relations:</b> Our experience of running VIT for the past 33 years in Vellore is being put to

              full use at VIT-AP at Amaravati. Our partnerships with reputed foreign universities like Purdue and RIT

              would continue at VIT-AP, thereby benefitting the students to participate in programmes such as

              Semester Abroad Programme (SAP) with scholarships and 2+2 degree programme through International

              Transfer Programme (ITP). We are also planning to get many of the professors abroad from our partner

              universities to visit our Amaravati campus to teach the students. The global VIT alumni network will be

              of immense help to the VIT-AP students.<br><br>

              <b>Industry Connections:</b> VIT’s strong connections with industries will prove to be very useful to the

              students. Industry experts have been involved in framing the curriculum and will be delivering guest

              lectures to the students. Students will also get the opportunity to solve industry-strength problems in their

              classrooms as part of the Project Based Learning (PBL). Students will get to do many projects as part of

              the ‘Engineering Clinics’ courses every semester. Apart from this, the mandatory co-op programme

              (internship) will tremendously boost the chances of getting a bright career in a great company. Placement

              is an important focus for VIT-AP. The placement services will be done by the central placement office in

              Vellore.<br><br>

              <b>Academics and Student Welfare:</b> Our student-focused faculty members, who come from reputed

              universities in India and abroad, are well trained to help the students solve application oriented problems.

              Every student will be allotted a faculty member as a mentor. The role of the mentor is to advise and guide

              the students to ensure their success in academics, career and life. Every student will also get the

              opportunity to participate in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities through numerous student clubs

              like music club, debate society, robotics club, dance club, entrepreneurship cell, trekking club,

              photography club, literary clubs and student associations such as IEEE, ASME, ACM, CSI, GDG

              (Google Developers Group) and ADG (Apple Developers Group). A vibrant campus life is very important

              for student’s growth.<br><br>

              <b>Facilities:</b> Students will be using modern classrooms with wifi-LCD projectors, audio-video systems and

              comfortable individual chairs. Students will enjoy the free wifi facility with high speed internet access in

              both the academic areas and hostel areas. The labs and project spaces will have the latest equipment to

              enable the students learn what is used in the industry. Students will also have sports facilities to nurture

              their talent in outdoor sports like cricket, basketball and volleyball, as well as the indoor games like table-

              tennis and chess. New apartment complex buildings in Guntur will house the men’s and women’s hostels

              separately. Like in our Vellore campus, the hostel buildings are completely secure with high-compound

              walls, security guards and surveillance cameras.  Only VIT authorized individuals can enter the building

              premises. Resident wardens will be present 24x7 to take care of the needs of the hostellers. Hostel rules

              must be observed by students. There will be health care and ambulance facility. New wifi-buses will ferry

              the students from the hostels to the campus. The men’s hostels will be shifted to the campus before the

              next academic year and the women’s hostels in the following year.<br><br>

              The classes commence on 19 th  July 2017 (Wednesday) and the hostellers will be occupying their hostels a

              day earlier. You will get more details regarding this later. If you have any questions, please feel free to

              call at 7901057255 (Any day 9 am to 9 pm) or email us at <a href="mailto:aphr@vit.ac.in">aphr@vit.ac.in</a>  Our

              website <a href="www.vit.ac.in/aphas">www.vit.ac.in/aphas</a> many details.

              <b>At VIT-AP, our full focus is on student success !!</b>

              Looking forward to meeting you in July …<br><br>
